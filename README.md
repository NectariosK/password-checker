# password-checker
Hi there,

Passwords are what we use to secure our accounts on the internet. 
With so many databases hacked in the past,websites like Pwned Passwords have enabled users to check if their passwords have been hacked from about 23,600 databases. 
It is mentioned that about 613,584,246 real world passwords have been exposed in data breaches in the past and this exposure makes them absolutely not suitabled for ongoing use as they are at much greater risk of being used to take over other accounts. They are searchable online from the website (https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords) below as well as being downloadable for use in other online systems.

With use of an Application Programming Interface (API), this project is focused on checking if your passwords have been leaked before and gives you a count of how many times that happened.

Cheers!
